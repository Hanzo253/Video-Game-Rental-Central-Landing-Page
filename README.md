## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.

- I built this app based on Figma designs: [Screenshot of designs](https://lensdump.com/i/gBJnNF)
- I worked with tasks on a Kanban board: [Screenshot of tasks](https://lensdump.com/a/glfFv)
- I used feature branches and Pull Requests: [Example Pull Request](https://lensdump.com/i/gBJoaq)
- I used VSCode as the IDE
- Created this landing page with HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript
- Used a little bit of bootstrap icons: [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)

## Why I built the project this way

- I wanted to create an E-commerce website for improving my web design and learning more about website layouts with HTML and CSS.
- This website was inspired by commercial video game rental businesses like GameFly.
- I wanted to explore more into responsive web design and practice for making real websites for an actual company.
- Since I mostly used HTML and CSS/SCSS for this project, it has given me a much better understanding of semantic HTML, flexbox, css grid, and responsive web design.

## If I had more time I would change this

- Make the website more responsive to apple devices
- Use a mobile-first development approach
- Add tests with Jest or Cypress
